        <span class="subhead">OUR STORY</span>
        <p>Periscope was founded on the belief that live video is a powerful source of truth and connects us in an
            authentic way with the world around us. We are fascinated by the idea of discovering the world through
            someone else’s eyes. What’s it like to see through the eyes of a protester in Ukraine? Or watch the sunrise
            from a hot air balloon in Cappadocia? <br><br>While there are many ways to discover events, movements and
            places, we realized there is no better way to experience something than through live video. A picture may be
            worth a thousand words, but live video lets us explore the world together.</p>
